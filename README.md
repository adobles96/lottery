# lottery

A chatbot-based lottery sales system (for spanish speakers).

## Architecture

Chatbot built on Dialogflow. Django backend to register ticket purchases and available contests. It was designed to receive payment through the user's cellphone bill, though this was left un-implemented. Twilio for integrating Dialogflow with SMS/Whatsapp. Heroku for deployment.
